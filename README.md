# About

This repository contains Python code annotations for the book Speech and Language Processing by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin. These annotations are designed to help users better understand the concepts and examples presented in the book. As of now, the annotations for Chapter 2 have been completed. Future updates will include additional chapters and examples as the work progresses.

# How to use?

Read the book in its entirety online at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/.

# Requirement

The code in the book was tested with Python 3.11, though most (but not all) will also work correctly with Python 2.7 and other older Python versions. We assume that you are familiar with the Python language.
